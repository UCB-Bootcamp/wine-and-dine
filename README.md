Wine and Dine is an application built to help users pair wine with food, or food with wine. Wine and Dine also offers alternative beer and cocktails options for users who would like a beverage other than wine.

When a user selects a wine, they are given a list of recipes that would pair with their selected wine. We also allow users to select a food item, and display a several wine options that would pair with their selected food item.

Users can like selected wines or recipes and have the option of viewing their liked items to revisit at a later time.

The application itself is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It also uses Material-UI as a UI Framework. It's deployed using Github Pages.

The deployed application can be found [here](https://ucb-bootcamp.github.io/wine-and-dine/).
