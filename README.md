### Overview
Wine and Dine is an application built to help users pair wine with food. Wine and Dine also offers alternative cocktail options for users who would like a beverage other than wine.

### Features
When a user selects a wine, they are given a list of recipes that would pair with their selected wine. 

A user can also hit a "Surprise Me!" button to be given a random wine and food pairing suggestion.

Users can view previously selected wines to revisit at a later time in their history page.

If a user feels like a cocktail instead of wine, they can select the cocktail button where they are given cocktail suggestions and a list of ingredients.

### Technology
The application itself is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript as core languages. It utilizes JQuery, and Materialize as a UI Framework. It uses icons from Material.io. It uses APIs from Unsplash, Spoonacular and the Cocktail DB. It's deployed using Github Pages.

The deployed application can be found [here](https://ucb-bootcamp.github.io/wine-and-dine/).
